# App Platform Troubleshooting Skill

Transform debugging from guessing to rapid diagnosis and fix.

## Philosophy

```
Traditional: See error → Guess → Change → Push → Wait 5-7 min → Repeat
With skill:  See error → Diagnose → Fix → Verify → Commit proper fix
```

## Quick Decision

```
Is the app deployed with running containers?
├── YES → Can we access the shell?
│         ├── YES → LIVE MODE (SDK shell access)
│         └── NO  → LOGS-ONLY MODE (fetch logs)
└── NO (build/deploy failed) → LOGS-ONLY MODE
```

---

## Mode 1: Live Troubleshooting (Quick Start)

```python
from do_app_sandbox import Sandbox

app = Sandbox.get_from_id(app_id="<app-id>", component="web")

# Diagnostics
app.exec("env | grep DATABASE")
app.exec("curl -v localhost:8080/health")
app.exec("ps aux | head -10")
```

**Full guide**: See [live-troubleshooting.md](reference/live-troubleshooting.md)

---

## Mode 2: Logs-Only (Quick Start)

```bash
# Runtime logs
doctl apps logs <app_id> <component> --type run

# Build logs
doctl apps logs <app_id> <component> --type build

# Crash logs
doctl apps logs <app_id> --type=run_restarted
```

**Full guide**: See [logs-analysis.md](reference/logs-analysis.md)

## Debug Container (Infrastructure Issues)

Deploy in ~30-45 seconds to isolate infrastructure from application:

```yaml
services:
  - name: debug
    image:
      registry_type: GHCR
      registry: ghcr.io
      repository: bikramkgupta/debug-python
      tag: latest
    http_port: 8080
    envs:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        value: ${db.DATABASE_URL}
```

```bash
# Run validation suite
validate-infra all
validate-infra database
validate-infra kafka
```

**Full guide**: See [debug-container.md](reference/debug-container.md)

## Quick Reference: Exit Codes

| Code | Signal | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| 0 | - | Clean exit (shouldn't exit) |
| 1 | - | General error |
| 127 | - | Command not found |
| 137 | SIGKILL | OOM killed |
| 143 | SIGTERM | Graceful shutdown |

---

## Quick Reference: Common Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| App exits immediately | Check if listening on $PORT |
| 502 errors | Check health endpoint, verify running |
| Database connection fails | Use Debug Container, verify trusted sources |
| Build fails | Check dependencies, review build logs |
| OOM kills | Upgrade instance size |
| Health checks fail | Bind to 0.0.0.0, not localhost |
| Slow startup | Increase initial_delay_seconds |

## When to Escalate

Contact DigitalOcean Support when:
- Internal error persists after redeploy
- Resource limit increases needed
- Multiple apps affected (platform issue)
- VPC/networking issues can't be diagnosed

**Before escalating, gather:**
```bash
doctl apps get <app_id> -o json > app_info.json
doctl apps logs <app_id> <component> --type run > runtime.log
doctl apps spec get <app_id> > app_spec.yaml
```
